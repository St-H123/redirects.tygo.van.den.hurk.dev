# [`redirects.tygo.van.den.hurk.dev`](https://redirects.tygo.van.den.hurk.dev/)
> This repository holds the source code for all the links that I need a redirect too. So if there is ever a link that needs to be spread around multiple websites, this is where I will put them. 

Every page added to this, Cannot be removed. Only the link may be altered to redirect some where else. This is to make sure that all links go somewhere. If I ever need to add a link for a project, and I forget about that project, then the link must always work. Which is where this redirect comes in. The redirect goes to github-pages instance for example.
